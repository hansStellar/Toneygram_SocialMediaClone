# Toneygram (Instagram Clone) :fire:

Toneygram is a clone of the Instagram social network. It is a project developed with the following technologies. 

1. Vue.js (JavaScript framework) 

2. Quasar (open-source Vue.js-based framework) 

3. Firebase (Database & Back-End Management) 

Toneygram has an authentication system where clients can log in and register through a CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete). Further, the user can upload photos to their profile, comment on a user's post, and edit and delete the comment on the said photo. 

Toneygram also has an instant messaging system, where the user can communicate with another user through their profile using the "Message" button. 

Finally, the web application has an integrated option from Firebase that makes it real-time. Therefore, a user can receive notifications in real-time (messaging, liked posts.)
